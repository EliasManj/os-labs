### Conclusions

Elias Manjarrez: This project was to follow a tutorial in order to create a simple kernel that outputs text to a screen with colors, 
the most problematic parts of this project was the building of the gcc cross-compiler with Binutils and installing all the dependencies and libraries.
Once that the gcc compiler was built, the implementation of the kernel was straightforward following the tutorial. In this project the color support feature 
was added to the kernel, this was done by changing the hex values that were assigned to the vga buffer.
