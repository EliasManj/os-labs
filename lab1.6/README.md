### Instructions

This project consists of designing a C program to serve as a shell interface
that accepts user commands and then executes each command in a separate
process. This project can be completed on any Linux, UNIX, or Mac OS X system.
A shell interface gives the user a prompt, after which the next command
is entered. The example below illustrates the prompt osh> and the userâ€™s
next command: cat prog.c. (This command displays the file prog.c on the
terminal using the UNIX cat command.)


`osh> cat prog.c`


One technique for implementing a shell interface is to have the parent process
first read what the user enters on the command line (in this case, cat
prog.c), and then create a separate child process that performs the command.
Unless otherwise specified, the parent process waits for the child to exit
before continuing. This is similar in functionality to the new process creation
illustrated in Figure 3.10. However, UNIX shells typically also allow the child
process to run in the background, or concurrently. To accomplish this, we add
an ampersand (&) at the end of the command. Thus, if we rewrite the above
command as


`osh> cat prog.c &`


the parent and child processes will run concurrently.
